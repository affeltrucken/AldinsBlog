# About me

My name is Aldin.

I'm a 19 year old aspiring penetration-tester and tech enthusiast from **Sweden**. I enjoy learning about everything from cybersecurity, to AI, coding and programming, webdev, reverse engineering. Basically *everything* and *anything* related to tech, new technologies, and IT.

Right now I am studying **pentesting** remotely at <a href="https://www.iths.se/">ITHs</a> in Stockholm. It's a two-year program focused on ethical hacking and practical knowledge that's applicable in the IT-security industry.

Some facts about me:
- 🐍 My language of choice is Python.
- 📷 I love photography.
- 🎞️ My favorite film is Amelié (2001).
- 🎧 I like making music, mainly House and DnB.
