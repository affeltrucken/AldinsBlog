This is my personal blog, made with **SvelteKit**. View the source code <a href="https://github.com/affeltrucken/AldinsBlog">here</a>

Here I'll upload blogs about my current projects, things I'm learning, and everything I might find along the way.

Topics mainly discussed will be:
- **Cybersecurity**
- **Web Development**
- **Programming**
- **Hacking**
- **Embedded Electronics**

and anything else I might find interesting.
